This ratio is found to be a constant for transition metals, and for heavy-fermion compounds, although at different values. In 1968 M. J. Rice pointed out that the coefficient A should vary predominantly as the square of the linear electronic specific heat coefficient \u03b3; in particular he showed that the ratio A/\u03b32 is material independent for the pure 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by very large values of A and \u03b3. Kadowaki and Woods showed that A/\u03b32 is material-independent within the heavy-fermion compounds, and that it is about 25 times larger than in aforementioned transition metals. According to the theory of electron-electron scattering the ratio A/\u03b32 contains indeed several non-universal factors, including the square of the strength of the effective electron-electron interaction. Since in general the interactions differ in nature from one group of materials to another, the same values of A/\u03b32 are only expected within a particular group.
