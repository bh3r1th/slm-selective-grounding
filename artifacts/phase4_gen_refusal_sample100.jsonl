When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, and thus can be readily explanted (surgically removed). In some cases, saline implant rupture can result in an infection due to bacteria or mold that had been within the implant, though this is uncommon. The follow-up report, Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3\u20135 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7\u201310 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation. In a study of his 4761 augmentation mammaplasty patients, Eisenberg reported that overfilling saline breast implants 10-13% significantly reduced the rupture-deflation rate to 1.83% at 8-years post-implantation. When a silicone breast implant ruptures it usually does not deflate, yet the filler gel does leak from it, which can migrate to the implant pocket; therefore, an intracapsular rupture (in-capsule leak) can become an extracapsular rupture (out-of-capsule leak), and each occurrence is resolved by explantation.

Reactions and uses Iodine monochloride is soluble in acids such as HF and HCl but reacts with pure water to form HCl, iodine, and iodic acid: + O2 + O2 ICl is a useful reagent in organic synthesis. It is used as a source of electrophilic iodine in the synthesis of certain aromatic iodides. It also cleaves C\u2013Si bonds. ICl will also add to the double bond in alkenes to give chloro-iodo alkanes.

The Wijs solution, iodine monochloride dissolved in acetic acid, is used to determine the iodine value of a substance. It can also be used to prepare iodates, by reaction with a chlorate. Chlorine is released as a byproduct. Iodine monochloride is a Lewis acid that forms 1:1 adducts with Lewis bases such as dimethylacetamide and benzene.

This ULX coincides with an optical source that has been interpreted to be a supergiant star, thus supporting the case that this may be an X-ray binary. NGC 1313 X1 and X2: NGC 1313, a spiral galaxy in the constellation Reticulum, contains two ultraluminous X-ray sources. These two sources had low temperature disk components, which was interpreted as possible evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole. However, while the low-energy emission can be modelled as a low-temperature disk, the high-energy emission is at odds with the intermediate-mass black hole hypothesis. Moreover, X-ray pulsations have been detected in NGC 1313 X-2, identifying the object as a neutron star. At the same time, the intermediate-mass black hole hypothesis cannot account for the presence of large optical bubbles surrounding each of the ULXs. It is more likely that these two ULXs host stellar-mass neutron stars', 'label': 'irrelevant', 'rank': 2, 'metadata': {'backfill': True, 'backfill_reason': 'insufficient_retrieval'}}\n\n{'doc_id': '5170455:1', 'title': 'Bozeman Icedogs', 'text': 'Rookie of the Year honors.

The now spacecraft uses less fuel to maintain a stable orbit, increasing its useful lifespan to more than 40 years. Instruments The heliospheric boundary of the Solar System is being imaged by measuring the location and magnitude of charge-exchange collisions occurring in all directions. The satellite's payload consists of two energetic neutral atom (ENA) imagers, IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo. Each consists of a collimator that limits their fields of view (FoV) a conversion surface to convert neutral hydrogen and oxygen into ions, an electrostatic analyzer (ESA) to suppress ultraviolet light and to select ions of a specific energy range, and a detector to count particles and identify the type of each ion. Both of these sensors are a single-pixel camera with a field of view of roughly 7\u00b0 x 7\u00b0. The IBEX-Hi instrument is recording particle counts in a higher energy band (300 eV to 6 keV) than the IBEX-Lo energy band (10 eV to 2 keV).
