For the rest of the year, periodic duels between the James River Squadron and the Federal shore batteries were the rule. The squadron stayed almost constantly below Drewry's Bluff. In January 1865, the James River Squadron ran past the barricades in the river in an attempt to disrupt Gen. U.S. Grant's supplies.

This ratio is found to be a constant for transition metals, and for heavy-fermion compounds, although at different values. In 1968 M. J. Rice pointed out that the coefficient A should vary predominantly as the square of the linear electronic specific heat coefficient \u03b3; in particular he showed that the ratio A/\u03b32 is material independent for the pure 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by very large values of A and \u03b3. Kadowaki and Woods showed that A/\u03b32 is material-independent within the heavy-fermion compounds, and that it is about 25 times larger than in aforementioned transition metals. According to the theory of electron-electron scattering the ratio A/\u03b32 contains indeed several non-universal factors, including the square of the strength of the effective electron-electron interaction.

This discrimination task is much more common than a simple AB task. Whorf hypothesis According to the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis (of which Lawrence's acquired similarity/distinctiveness effects would simply be a special case), language affects the way that people perceive the world. For example, colors are perceived categorically only because they happen to be named categorically: Our subdivisions of the spectrum are arbitrary, learned, and vary across cultures and languages. But Berlin & Kay (1969) suggested that this was not so: Not only do most cultures and languages subdivide and name the color spectrum the same way, but even for those who don't, the regions of compression and separation are the same.
