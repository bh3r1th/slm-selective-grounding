When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, and thus can be readily explanted (surgically removed). In some cases, saline implant rupture can result in an infection due to bacteria or mold that had been within the implant, though this is uncommon. The follow-up report, Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation. In a study of his 4761 augmentation mammaplasty patients, Eisenberg reported that overfilling saline breast implants 10-13% significantly reduced the rupture-deflation rate to 1.83% at 8-years post-implantation. When a silicone breast implant ruptures it usually does not deflate, yet the filler gel does leak from it, which can migrate to the implant pocket; therefore, an intracapsular rupture (in-capsule leak) can become an extracapsular rupture (out-of-capsule leak), and each occurrence is resolved by explantation. Although the leaked silicone filler-gel can migrate from the chest tissues to elsewhere in the woman's\n\nelected Councillor General of Sospel (1931), then deputy of the first circumscription of Nice (1932). Politically republican, democratic, independent and moderate, he sat within the left-leaning independents, then moved more to the centre with the local political party he created called “Le Rassemblement des Indépendants” (“The Assembly of Independents”). However, Médecin increasingly moved toward the far right, and joined Jacques Doriot's fascist Parti Populaire Français in 1936. Elected Senator of the Alpes-Maritimes in 1939, he voted with enthusiasm for the giving of full powers to Maréchal Philippe Pétain, whom he wanted to conserve his mandates. But in 1942, he did not support the Italian fascists then in occupation of Nice. In open dispute with the government, he was removed from his mayorship in 1943. He fled to Avignon and then to Annot, but he was arrested in 1944 and incarcerated in Nice. He was moved to Belfort in the same year, where he was able to escape captivity.

It ushered in Electronic countermeasures (ECM) warfare, jamming enemy radar installations from October 1942 as the only such squadron in the RAF initially. Later in the war 515 Sqn was joined by other squadrons as part of No. 100 Group RAF. The squadron disbanded after VE day, when the need for such a specialised squadron had reduced. History Fighter Command The squadron was formed from Defiant Flight, also known as Special Duties Flight – an electronic countermeasuress unit equipped with the Boulton Paul Defiant Mk.II – at RAF Northolt on 1 October 1942, It moved to RAF Heston later that month. As part of 11 Group, 515 Sqn performed radar jamming duties, using Moonshine and Mandrel equipment. From May 1943, 515 Sqn re-equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter Mk.IIF. Bomber Command The squadron transferred to No. 100 Group RAF in December 1943 as part of Bomber Command, and moved to RAF Little Snoring in Norfolk. There they re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquito Mk.VIs\n\nPotemkin as towed her back to Sevastopol from Constanța, Romania, where Potemkins crew had sought asylum. Sinop and both pursued Potemkin to Odessa, but the crew of the latter mutinied themselves in sympathy with the crew of the Potemkin. However, loyal members of the crew regained control of the ship the next day and grounded her. A number of proposals were made in the 1900s to reconstruct them and replace their obsolete armor and guns, but none of these were carried out. Ekaterina II and Chesma were both eventually sunk as target ships after being decommissioned in 1907, but both Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were converted into artillery training ships before becoming guardships at Sevastopol before World War I. There they spent most of the war and were captured by the Germans in 1918, who eventually turned them over to the British, who sabotaged their engines when they abandoned the Crimea in 1919. Immobile, they were captured by both the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War.

The Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and the United States Navy, all of them, were designed to use the same type of turbine propulsion system. The design of the turbine was based on the principles of the early 20th-century steam engine, and the turbines were constructed from steel, brass, and copper. The turbines were designed to be highly reliable and durable, and they were used in a wide range of applications, including the construction of ships, the transportation of goods, and the generation of electricity. The turbines were also used in the construction of the Great Wall of China, the Panama Canal, and the Panama Canal.\n\nThe first turbine was built", "model": "google/gemma-3-1b-it", "mode": "base"}

History Sydney First clubs and matches (1865–1867) On 26 May 1865, calls were put out to form a Sydney Football Club. The club was incorporated on 17 June 1865 with Richard Driver as its first president and up to 60 members, of whom were mostly cricketers. It played its first match shortly thereafter in Hyde Park, Sydney, and in August against Sydney University. Two other clubs, the Australian Club and a Sydney University team, played football matches against the Sydney club in 1865, though it is\n\nassigned temporarily to cover the Richmond defenses and free troops for use in the field. Sailors continued to be used ashore for the rest of the war, especially at Drewry's Bluff. At the end of May 1864, obstructions were removed from the James River by the Confederates, and the squadron was sent down river, only to find that the Federals had built their own barricades. The squadron continued shelling the Federals ashore at intervals until August 13, when a full naval bombardment was opened on the Federal Army. For the rest of the year, periodic duels between the James River Squadron and the Federal shore batteries were the rule. The squadron stayed almost constantly below Drewry's Bluff. In January 1865, the James River Squadron ran past the barricades in the river in an attempt to disrupt Gen. U.S. Grant's supplies. During the fight, many of the ships were lost, others damaged to varying degrees. That night the river rose, floating the ironclads, and the James River Squadron tried to run under the cover of dark.

Epistemic anti-realism Just as moral anti-realism asserts the nonexistence of normative facts, epistemic anti-realism asserts the nonexistence of facts in the domain of epistemology. Thus, the two are now sometimes grouped together as \"metanormative anti-realism\". Prominent defenders of epistemic anti-realism include Hartry Field, Simon Blackburn, Matthew Chrisman, and Allan Gibbard, among others.

Following the All-Star weekend, Rondo recorded a career-high 16 assists in a home victory against the Charlotte Bobcats. Despite his solid rookie year, there was much speculation about Boston needing a veteran point guard. In March, they signed veteran point guard Sam Cassell as a free agent to serve as a backup.

In his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to \"bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form\", although what he meant by \"paganism\" was unclear. Crowley also wrote in the 4th Book of Magick about a great pagan Umbral fleet ruled by Ottovius that would be handed down to the great Spartan. The esoteric nature of this was also unclear. Crowley's thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them the works of Hermeticism and the writings of the occultist, William Blake. The 19th century saw a surge in interest in occultism and mysticism, with the rise of new schools of thought and the emergence of new forms of magical practice. The occultism of the 19th century was characterized by a focus on the individual's inner world, the exploration of the unconscious, and the use of symbolism and ritual. The 20th century saw a shift in the focus of occultism, with a greater emphasis on the collective and the social, and the rise of new forms of magical practice, such as", "model": "google/gemma-3-1b-it", "mode": "base"}

According to Cardinal Edward Cassidy, the report contains three principles: that individuals have the freedom to follow their conscience, that Eastern Catholic Churches have the right to exist, that uniatism is not the current method of full communion; and two conclusions: that the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches are \"sister churches\" and that rebaptism should be avoided. The principle that \"the inviolable freedom of persons and their obligation to follow the requirements of their conscience\", is foundational, according to Cassidy, \"and justifies both the personal choice to adhere to the Catholic Church or to the Orthodox Church, and offers the possibility of returning to the Catholic Church for those communities which in 1945–49 had been forced to convert by Communist regimes to become part of the Orthodox Church,\" as happened in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
